# Credit Risk Classification - Analysis Report


## Overview

In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Tasks

Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report


## Questions Asked

Question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

Answer: The logistic regression model predicts a healthy loan has a low risk with a 100% precision rate. Where as the high-risk loan predicts an 87% precision rate. This makes the balanced accuracy of the model a total of 94%.


Question: How well does the logistic regression model, fit with oversampled data, predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

Answer: The logistic regression model best fits with the oversampled data with a healthy prediction of 100%. As for the high-risk loan prediction, there is a 87% prediction rate. The balanced accuracy model averages at 100%.
